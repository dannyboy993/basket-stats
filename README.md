This simple app is my first project in Android ever. It is written in Java and XML. App allows users to enter 6 players for 3x3 Basketball so they will be divided into two teams. 
Then in the second screen user can click or press on the name of the player and then on the action that is committed like made or missed shot, made assist or rebound. 
When the game is over, user should press a button that opens up third screen which contains statistics for every player in the game. 

Currently I am improving this app to be more flexible, more responsive by remaking it in Kotlin and Jetpack Compose.
